# Library
A simple UI based DBMS for a library.  
It uses Apache server for testing on localhost, and MySQL as a DB.  
UI is designed using Qt Designer.  
`sqlclient` library is used to connect UI with the DB.

  
    
Currently, it only supports one table to store books. The UI has functionality for books CRUD operations.
